#RideNow - Yale

RideNow - Yale is a messenger bot that can help you find your way around the Yale campus using Yale's very own transit system.

The bot simplifies the usual process of picking a bus route using the TransLoc Rider app, and makes smart suggestions on which routes you could take to get to your destination from your current location.

###Features:

The bot is written using Node.js and uses wit.ai for the Natural Language support. Users can do the following:

- Start a conversation with the bot by greeting it (e.g: "Hello!")
- Share their location using Messenger's built-in location-sharing option when prompted
- Input their desired destination when prompted
- Browse through a list of suggestions, which include bus route name, arrival time, stops to get on/ off the bus, and a map showing the location of the stop to board the bus at

###Note:

The bot can only suggest routes if you are somewhere within or close to the Yale campus. West Campus bus routes are not supported yet.

<sub><sup>The bot does not, by any means, guarantee the viability of the routes it suggests, neither is it or its developers responsible for the safety of the user(s). Please use your judgement when choosing a route suggested by the bot.</sup></sub>
